<!-- You may be familiar with the meta element already; it is used to specify information about the page, such as the title, description, keywords, and author.

Give your page a meta element with an appropriate charset value.

The charset attribute specifies the character encoding of the page, and, nowadays, UTF-8 is the only encoding supported by most browsers. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
