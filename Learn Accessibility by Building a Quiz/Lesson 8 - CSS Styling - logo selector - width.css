/* A useful property of an SVG (scalable vector graphics) is that it contains a path attribute which allows the image to be scaled without affecting the resolution of the resultant image.

Currently, the img is assuming it's default size, which is too large. Correctly, scale the image using it's id as a selector, and setting the width to max(100px, 18vw). */
