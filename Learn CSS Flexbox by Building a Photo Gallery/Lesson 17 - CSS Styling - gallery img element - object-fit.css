/* Notice how some of your images have become distorted. This is because the images have different aspect ratios. Rather than setting each aspect ratio individually, you can use the object-fit property to determine how images should behave.

Give your #gallery img selector the object-fit property and set it to cover. This will tell the image to fill the img container while maintaining aspect ratio, resulting in cropping to fit. */
